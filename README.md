# GeoNLP: Semantic Text Analysis for Geoscience Literature

A collection of Jupyter notebooks and Python tools for extracting, analyzing, and visualizing semantic relationships in geoscience literature using NLP, entropy-based metrics, and co-occurrence networks.

Developed as part of my MSc thesis in geology and NLP at the University of Saskatchewan.

## 🔍 Notebooks Overview

### `1_xdd_data_extraction.ipynb`

* Connects to the [xDD API](https://xDD.wisc.edu/) to retrieve text snippets for geological search terms.
* Parses and saves results to local `.csv` files by term.

### `2_calculate_statistics.ipynb`

* Computes statistical relationships from the corpus:

  * Word and pair frequencies
  * Joint entropy, mutual information
  * Co-occurrence probabilities

### `3_import_to_postgres.ipynb`

* Loads all calculated statistics into a PostgreSQL database.
* Ensures tables for `term_stats`, `term_pairs`, and `term_cooccurrence` are created and filled.

## 🌐 Explore the Results Online

After processing and importing the data, you can explore the semantic relationships using the **web-based GeoNLP App** — no coding required.

This app was built to **democratize access** to geoscientific text mining tools, making them available to a broader audience regardless of technical background.

### 🔗 Web App Access

You can explore the interactive co-occurrence networks and mutual information results directly via:

👉 **[GeoNLP App](https://geo-nlp-portal.onrender.com/)**

### 🧭 Key Features:

* Search for geological terms (e.g., `"volcanic arc"`)
* Visualize semantic networks of related words
* Filter edges by co-occurrence probability
* Highlight nodes by type (e.g., mineral, lithology, structure)
* Download raw statistics for external use

> 🧪 *This web app complements the code in this repository, offering a no-code interface for geoscientists, students, and the public.*

## 💻 Installation - (Unneccessary if using the App)

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DHeasmanGDS/msc-geonlp-notebooks
cd msc-geonlp-notebooks
```

---

### 2. Set Up the Conda Environment

Create the environment from the included `.yml` file:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate msc-geonlp-notebooks
```

> 📝 **Note**: If the environment file doesn't install everything perfectly (e.g., issues with `psycopg2`), you can manually install missing packages:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge psycopg2
```

---

### 3. Set Up Your `.env` File

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with:

```
DB_USER=your_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=geonlp
```

---

* 📚 **Jupyter Notebooks**
* 🗃️ **PostgreSQL** for structured data storage
* 🌐 **FastAPI** for serving the visualization app
* 📈 **Pyvis** for interactive semantic networks
* 📊 **Entropy & MI** as information-theoretic metrics
